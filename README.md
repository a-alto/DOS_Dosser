# DOS Dosser

A very basic experiment of a dosser I made when I was learning about the topic for the first time.  
It repeatedly calls Pings from the Command Prompt console and launch them to the specified target.

### Usage

#### ddssr.bat
```
ddssr target_site buffer_dimension num_of_packets
```

#### ddssrcomp.bat
```
ddssrcomp target_site buffer_dimension
```
